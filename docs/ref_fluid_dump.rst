Reading GRMHD Output Files
==========================

There are two levels of interface for reading GRMHD files in pyharm.  The more common is the higher-level :class:`pyharm.fluid_dump.FluidDump` class, but for more control one can opt to use the :mod:`pyharm.io` module.

This page has the documentation for creating & using `FluidDump` objects, but to get anything from them you will want to see :ref:`keys`.
